# WP-CLI Automation
WordPress installation with WP-CLI automation utility tool. It works on the top of WP-CLI. You don't need to memorize arguments while you're installing WordPress. Just one command and then follow the instractions, just like Node package init.
It's a Bash script, so I guess it'll only work on Linux and MacOS. 
You must have wpcli installed in your machine. WP-CLI intallation guidline: [Click Here](https://wp-cli.org/)
